## Introduction to genAI

genAI, short for generative artificial intelligence, refers to AI systems designed to create new content,
 such as text, images, and music, that are often indistinguishable from those created by humans. The concept
  originated from advancements in machine learning, particularly in neural networks and deep learning, which have enabled
   sophisticated pattern recognition and generation capabilities. Early forms of genAI date back to the 1950s with simple
    rule-based systems, but significant progress was made in the 2010s with the development of generative adversarial networks
     (GANs) and transformer models. These technologies allow genAI to learn from vast datasets and generate outputs that can
      simulate human creativity and expression.
